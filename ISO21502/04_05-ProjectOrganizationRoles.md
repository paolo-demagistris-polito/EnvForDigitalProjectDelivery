2. motivating the project team;
3. providing day-to-day supervision and leadership;
4. defining the approach, responsibilities, scope of work and targets for the team;
5. monitoring, forecasting and reporting overall progress against the project plan (see 7.2 and 7.15);
6. managing risks (see 7.8) and issues (see 7.9);
7. controlling and managing project changes (see 7.10);
8. managing supplier performance as defined in relevant contracts (see 7.17);
9. ensuring stakeholder engagement (see 7.12) and communication (see 7.13) takes place as planned;
10. validating the deliverables and outcomes provided by the project.

The project manager can be assisted by a project management team, with members undertaking specific roles, such as scheduling, cost control and quality assurance.
