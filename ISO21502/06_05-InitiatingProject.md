# Initiating a project

## Overview

The purpose of initiating a project is to plan the project, define the project organization, mobilize the
project team, define project governance and management, identify stakeholders and verify the project is justified.

Lessons learned from previous, relevant projects should be considered. The activities can be iterative, until an acceptable solution and plan is developed and can be further iterated in subsequent phases of the project.

>NOTE 1: **“Initiating a project”** can also be referred to as **“starting a project”** or **“project initiation”**.

>NOTE 2: See [see Project Organization and Roles, Project Manager](04_05-ProjectOrganizationRoles.md#project-manager) for the project manager’s role concerning initiating a project.

## Project team mobilization

The project manager should mobilize the team, facilities, equipment and other resources required to undertake the project.

The project team should understand their roles and the project’s requirements, assumptions, constraints and potential risks.

Project work should be undertaken in cross-functional
teams and assigned to individuals who are competent to accomplish the role and have the capacity to
deliver the expected governance results.

See **Resources management** for further information.

## Project governance and management approach

The governance and management framework should be defined to provide direction and working methods to those individuals involved in the project. 

Governance and management frameworks, as well as controls, should be proportionate and appropriate to the work to be done and its expected degree of complexity.

The project manager, in consultation with the project sponsor should define the way in which the project is to be initiated, directed, monitored, controlled and closed, while conforming to the governance requirements (see 4.3).

Typically, this should include:

1. project life cycle (see 4.4); 
2. project organization, roles and responsibilities (see 4.5);
3. processes and methods for undertaking the management activities described in Clauses 6 and 7;
4. processes and methods for delivering the project’s outputs and outcomes (see 6.7).

The project management approach can be described in a single document, a single overarching document with a set of subsidiary documents or a set of subsidiary documents covering specific practices, such as a risk or quality management plan (see ISO 21505).

>NOTE: The names of documents describing the management approach can differ. Example names include
>
>* “project management plan”,
>* “project initiation documentation”,
>* “project definition document”,
>* “project implementation plan”,
>* “project charter”, and
>* “project terms of reference”.
>
>Subsidiary documents for specific project management practices are sometimes referred to as “management plans”, e.g. “risk management plan or strategy”, “quality management plan or strategy”, “scope management plan or strategy”.

## Initial project justification

The initial justification for the project should build on the rationale in the preliminary justification from the pre-project activities (see 6.2).

This justification should be documented in a business case (see 4.3.2). The business case can be developed over a number of project phases as work progresses and should be updated to reflect significant changes in the project’s context and scope.

The business case should demonstrate the fit to the organization’s strategy, financial viability,
commercial viability and practicality of delivery within an acceptable level of risk.

Alternative options for the approach to be taken and solution to be selected should be assessed and reasons for rejection given. If a project is part of a programme, its business case can be included within the programme’s business case.

>NOTE: While the document justifying the undertaking of a project is often referred to as a “business case”,
the actual name used can vary from sector to sector or the method used.

## Initial project planning

An initial plan for the project should be developed with milestones and gates or decision points based
on the project life cycle combined with a detailed plan for at least the immediate phase of the project.

The transition of outputs to operations or customer should be considered if the transition is considered part of the project.

At this early stage of the project, this consideration can include several options, which can be developed  further in later phases of the project (see 7.2).
