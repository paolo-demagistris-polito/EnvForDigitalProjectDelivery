# Project design

## Definition

Design describes how the demands, wishes and influences of the organisation(s) are interpreted and weighed by the individual and translated into a high-level design of the project to ensure the highest probability of success. Derived from this outer context, design drafts a ‘charcoal sketch’ a blueprint or overall architecture of how the project should be set up, laid out and managed. This considers resources, funds, stakeholders’ objectives, benefits and organisational change, risks and opportunities, governance, delivery, priorities and urgency. Because all outer factors and success criteria (and/or the perceived relevance of these) often change over time, this design needs to be evaluated periodically and, if necessary, adjusted.

## Purpose

The purpose of this competence element is to enable the individual to successfully integrate all contextual and social aspects and derive the most advantageous approach for a project to ensure buy-in and success.

## Description

Design addresses the development, implementation and maintenance of an approach that best serves the organisational objectives and takes into account all formal and informal factors that help or hinder the corporate goals and the success or failure of the specific project. Design includes taking into account the intent, governance, structures and processes, relevant standards and regulations, cultural aspects, and personal and group interests in the organisation (or organisations) and the wider society. In selecting the choice for the approach, lessons learned from other projects within the organisation, the industry or from outside and the specifics of this project, also play an important role.

Design addresses a broad range of aspects, including decision-making, reporting and resources, as well as meeting standards and regulations and complying with cultural norms and values (within the organisation and the wider society). Aspects such as perceived benefits, motivation, team and stakeholder communication, etc have also to be taken into account. Defining these objectives, factors and criteria distinctly and clearly is a major requirement from the outset and during the execution of the project. This activity results in a thoroughly situational high-level sketch that will later be translated into specific actions that should lead to success for the project. The chosen approach also includes the management and control philosophy. The architecture reflects rhythm, balance and commitment and provides guidance to the component tasks and their place in the project.

The selection of the approach and the design activities have to be performed before jumping into planning, organising and executing the project. Furthermore, during the project’s life-cycle this chosen approach should be regularly ‘re-thought’ and challenged as circumstances change both from within the project and from the larger context.

## Key competence indicators

### Acknowledge, prioritise and review success criteria

Success criteria are measures that stakeholders use to rate and judge the success of the project. These criteria can be both formal and informal. Formal criteria address the stated objectives of the project. To achieve these goals and objectives within the agreed constraints (e.g. strategic goals, tactical and operational objectives) is one – but just one– part of project success. Informal criteria by which interested parties evaluate the outcome are also important. These factors may include the true reasons why a project is started, supported, thwarted or ended. Success criteria also address the interaction with the larger context – the personal or group interests that are influenced by the project or its result, depending on how a project supports or conflicts with other projects and programmes, activities, goals, resources, etc. The individual collects, acknowledges, prioritises and completes both formal and informal success criteria for the project. Not only the formal criteria, but also the informal ones, need to be taken seriously by the individual, as they will significantly influence the willingness of interested parties to support and cooperate with the project and so directly influence its success.

The success criteria play a crucial role in defining the approach. For instance, if the main criterion is the quality of the end product, quality processes, quality reviews and assurance and quality consideration will play an important role in the chosen approach. This approach would differ substantially from a project with the focus on time (speed of delivery) or budget. Success factors are elements that individuals can incorporate into their project to increase the likelihood of meeting the success criteria and achieving a successful outcome. These factors may come from very different sources and take different shapes. They vary from using (or avoiding) specific tools, methods or techniques, selecting specific resources, organisation setup, stages, reporting and communication means and styles, quality methods, etc. During the course of every project the relative importance of success factors and criteria may change, due to contextual or social aspects and the dynamics of the project itself. Therefore the individual periodically checks and assesses the actuality and relative importance of the success criteria and – when necessary – makes due changes in the approach in order to attain success. These changes may even include advising the organisation to prematurely end the project.

#### Measures

* Identifies, classifies, evaluates and prioritises influences from each of the five perspective aspects relevant for success;
* Recognises and assesses both formal and informal influencing elements;
* Evaluates and prioritises success criteria from each of the five contextual aspects;
* Acknowledges and assesses both formal and informal success criteria;
* Acknowledges and uses relevant success factors;
* Performs periodic re-assessments of the relevance of success criteria;
* Performs periodic re-assessments of the relevance of success factors.

### Review, apply and exchange lessons learned from and with other projects

### Determine complexity and its consequences for the approach

### Select and review the overall project management approach

### Design the project execution architecture
