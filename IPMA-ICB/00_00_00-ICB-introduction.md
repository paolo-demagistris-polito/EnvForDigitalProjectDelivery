# Introduction

The profession of project management is changing rapidly. Organisations have evolved their ability to define and implement new areas of work, with more integration across projects and more focus on the long-term benefits. Therefore, project management is established as the preeminent method for implementing change in the world and project, programme and portfolio managers are leading the way. The professionals of tomorrow will work in distributed environments with overlapping and often conflicting stakeholder interests. They will be shaped by real-time data and performance management tools, challenged with too much information and not enough communication and judged by their ability to deliver products or services that align with short and long-term strategies, to deliver benefits. It is into these increasingly demanding challenges that the IPMA Individual Competence Baseline, Version 4.0 (IPMA ICBÂ®) is introduced.

The IPMA ICB is a global standard that defines the competences required by individuals working in the fields of project, programme and portfolio management. The IPMA ICB builds upon the prior editions and presents new insights and directions for a wider range of purposes. It serves a broad range of audiences, including educators, trainers, practitioners, human resource (HR) professionals and assessors. Within the IPMA 4-Level-Certification system, the IPMA ICB serves also as the baseline for assessments.

The IPMA ICB represents a major advancement for successful and modern project, programme and portfolio management. This version describes three domains of expertise extant in business today - project management, programme management and portfolio management. The IPMA ICB describes individuals who work in these domains, while avoiding role-specific terminology because although a role name may change, the underlying concept remains valid.

The IPMA ICB takes the IPMA Eye of Competence (chapter 3, page 25) into the next generation, with a redefinition of the competence elements (CEs) required by the modern project manager.

28 CEs are organised in three competence areas:

* People. People CEs define the personal and interpersonal competences required to succeed in projects, programmes and portfolios;
* Practice. Practice CEs define the technical aspects of managing projects, programmes and portfolios;
* Perspective. Perspective CEs define the contextual competences that must be navigated within and across the broader environment.

The profession of project management has become a global profession. Organisations frequently engage in projects, programmes and portfolios that cross organisational, regional, national and international borders. The modern manager must work with a wide range of partners outside of their organisation and with a broad array of factors including industry, culture, language, socio-economic status and organisation types. Project management has to be applied taking these contextual facets into consideration and often these broader contexts are seen as the most critical success factor. The IPMA ICB emphasises these challenges.
