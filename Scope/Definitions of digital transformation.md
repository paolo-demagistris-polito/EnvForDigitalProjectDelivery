4. [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/digital-transformation) Digital transformation can refer to anything from IT modernization (for example, cloud computing), to digital optimization, to the invention of new digital business models. The term is widely used in public-sector organizations to refer to modest initiatives such as putting services online or legacy modernization. Thus, the term is more like “digitization” than “digital business transformation.”.

5. [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/eu/products/platform/what-is-digital-transformation/) Digital transformation is the process of using digital technologies to create new — or modify existing — business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet changing business and market requirements. This reimagining of business in the digital age is digital transformation. It transcends traditional roles like sales, marketing, and customer service. Instead, digital transformation begins and ends with how you think about, and engage with, customers.  As we move from paper to spreadsheets to smart applications for managing our business, we have the chance to reimagine how we do business — how we engage our customers — with digital technology on our side. For small businesses just getting started, there’s no need to set up your business processes and transform them later. You can future-proof your organization from the word go. Building a 21st-century business on stickies and handwritten ledgers just isn’t sustainable. Thinking, planning, and building digitally sets you up to be agile, flexible, and ready to grow.

6. [CIO](https://www.cio.com/article/230425/what-is-digital-transformation-a-necessary-disruption.html) Digital transformation is a foundational change in how an organization delivers value to its customers, a catchall term for describing the implementation of new technologies, talent, and processes to improve business operations and satisfy customers.
