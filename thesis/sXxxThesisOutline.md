# Thesis title

Propose a concise verb + object statement.

Example: *Digitally enabling construction project governance*

## Abstract

The abstract is written at the end of the thesis preparation. It is a concise summary of your thesis.

## Introduction

### Background

This section should be the shortest part of the abstract and should very briefly outline the following information:

1. What is already known about the subject, related to the thesis in question, and
2. What is not known about the subject and hence what the study intended to examine (or what the thesis seeks to present).

### Thesis purpose

How you will develop the subject against the situation stated in the background and therefore contribute value to the intended audience.

### Context

Describe the conditions that exists during the thesis, how they have been setup and highlight if this led to opportunities or limitations.

### Stakeholders

The parties (people and organizations) that engaged actively or passively in the thesis context.

## Literature

Before you begin stating your broad research question, take as much time as is necessary for a thorough literature review.

This type of scoping exercise is important to confirm that your thesis purpose has not already been answered and that it is relevant to others.

Furthermore, a thorough understanding of the state of the evidence will provide context for your research question and likely will help to identify other gaps in the literature that might be worth addressing. This early effort will pay off when it comes time to actually perform research e prepare the thesis. This work is extremely helpful to provide context and rationale for your work.

### L. review

List the main take-aways from existing research into the thesis subject. Use a proper citation system.

Outline what is already known about the subject, related to the thesis in question.

### L. gaps

Outline as a result of above what is not known about the subject and hence what the study intended to examine (or what the thesis seeks to present).

## Design

The thesis at polito pm-lab are based on quantitative research. Therefore they are about running an experiment yielding data that cna be analyzed against the research question.

Design is about planning the experiment so that one is sure that meaningful data are obtained within the context of the thesis.

### Research questions

RQs represent the aim of the thesis. In LR we obtained gaps, things that the scientific community doesn't know about the thesis subject.

The RQ represent the information we would like to obtain so that the thesis purpose is achieved.

For example, if the title is *Digitally enabling construction project governance* and from LR we got that nobody has reported on using a Javascript based frontend environment, the RQ could be:

**What are the benefits to project governance using a React based PIMS (project information management system) frontend?**

### Methodology

The methodology is about describing how an experiment can be designed and run using sound and proven methods, techniques and tools.

At polito pm-lab we prefer the Contructive research approach, defined in this paper https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/17538371111164029/full/html?casa_token=SPEvuDc8COkAAAAA:GbVIhz_PvqAh9-rSNil2MKfjDxAsHw3P0w0nBETlKkDAqd60WPpucKMqq3txC6Tg3SVyWCm_6R2j8hkHg-ov7mh9nvhXspwpPmVJFj-nFiLxb9rnh_9q

There you will find the following definition:

> Constructive research is used to define and solve problems, as well as to improve an existing system or performance, with the overall implication of adding to the existing body of knowledge. Constructive research can be characterized as applied studies which often result in new knowledge in the form of normative applications. Although many studies can be categorised under applied studies, what differentiate them is their end results. For instance, basic studies assist in knowledge enhancement without any explicit normative purposes and form, while development techniques help to improve skills and means. Analytic model building produces an elegantly proven problem solution which works in principle but whose actual practical adequacy usually remains unclear. In addition, the constructive research approach is not a consulting exercise because scientific methods are not an inevitable condition for successful consulting work

### Experiment design

Experiment design is about deciding the configuration that allows to gather data against the RQ.

In the exemple above we can methodologically decide to go with constructive research: make apiece of code that implements PIMS with React and test it with students that have to prepare a thesis, whre the thesis is condidered a project.

Design is about configuring each and every piece of the PIMS (platform, backend, frontend) so that thesis students can use it.

## Experiment

Describe the experiment implementation from design phase:

1. how is setup
2. how was developed
3. how many runs and adjustments that were needed
4. what data was collected
5. how data was collected

## Conclusions

In quantitative research, conclusions, that are the answer to the RQ, are obtained from data.

### Data analysis

Describe how data was treated to obtain information against the RQ

### Findings

Describe the findings from data analysis.

Describe them taking care to highlight:

1. Research limitations/implications: this section suggests how the findings may be important for policy, practice, theory, and subsequent research. The limitations of the study are those characteristics of design or methodology that impacted or influenced the interpretation of the findings from your research. They are the constraints on generalization, applications to practice, and/or utility of findings that are the result of the ways in which you initially chose to design the study and/or the method used to establish internal and external validity. Research implications are basically the conclusions that you draw from your results and explain how the findings may be important for policy, practice, or theory. However, the implications need to be substantiated by evidence and the study's parameters need to be explained and the limitations taken into account to avoid over-generalization of results.
2. Originality/value: This section should contain the most important new contributions to the subject to take-home, expressed in a few precisely worded sentences. Usually, the finding highlighted here relates to the primary outcome measure; however, other important or unexpected findings should also be mentioned. This section has the most impact on the average reader because readers generally trust authors and take their assertions at face value. For this reason, the conclusions should also be scrupulously honest; and authors should not claim more than their data demonstrate.
